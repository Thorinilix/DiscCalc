DiscCalc
========

Simple Discount Calculator made for my old retail job. This utility is free to use by anyone who 
needs a quick and easy discount program for POS systems that do not have this necessary(?) feature.

This program was one of my earliest programming projects that I adapted to actual use. As a result, a lot of programming
best practices were not observed. Since I no longer work for the job this was made for, I really have no need or desire to 
fix these issues. As of July 2014 the program is bug free to my knowledge.
